## 📊 Project Overview  
The **College Event Feedback Analysis** project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected after college events.  
By applying **sentiment analysis**, we can determine whether each piece of feedback is **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative**, providing actionable insights to improve future events.

**Key Features:**  
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Sentiment Classification using **TextBlob**  
- Visualization of Sentiment Distribution  
- Exported final dataset to `College_Event_Feedback_Result.csv`
